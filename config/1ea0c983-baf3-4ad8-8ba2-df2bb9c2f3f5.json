    "description": "\n*(based on STET 1.4.1.3)*\n\nThis API intends to provide an interface between\n\n- Account Servicing Payment Service Providers (ASPSP)\n\n- LUXHUB\n\n\n**LUXHUB provides authorization and security services for the APSPS. PSD2 TPPs are connecting and are authorized by LUXHUB and\ntheir requests are forwarded towards the ASPSP, with same data and a changed security profile.**\n\n**This API is modeled using STET v1.4.1 as a base, with the changed security profile. There is no modification of request/response messages whatsoever, compared to the base API, except for:**\n- additional HTTP headers: \n  - LH-PSU-Token - to pass PSU and related entities identifiers\n  - LH-Correlation-ID - unique request identifier set by LUXHUB firewall\n- additional query parameter - BIC (Bank Identifier Code) to support multi entity bank routing\n\n**The API documentation below is as per base API, i.e. STET API standard**\n\n**Each ASPSP needs to customize this standard API and add his own version number to the above version, for example in case of internal ASPSP API version 001 the version should be like: 1.1413.036.001 .**\n\n**The version number in this file is hence *publishedVersion>.standardVersion.luxhubVersion.aspspVersion* showing the order of customization hierarchy. The *publishedVersion* has to correspond to the last part of the base path as visible in servers section below.**\n\n**During API deployment in the gateway a deployment number will be added automatically so the version number visible will be like: 1.1413.036.001.3064a6a**\n\n# Summary\nThis API intends to provide an interface between\n- Account Servicing Payment Service Providers (ASPSP)\n- Third Party (Payment Service) Providers (TPP)\n\nTPP may act with different roles as described below:\n- Account Information Service Providers (AISP)\n- Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISP)\n- Card Based Payment Instrument Issuers (CBPII)\n\nThe Payment Service User (PSU) is the owner of the accounts held by the ASPSP and gives accreditations to the TPP in order to access his accounts information or initiates payment from these accounts\n\nThe API is designed on a REST model using JSON structures.\n\nThe Richardson Maturity Model is applied on level three using HAL HYPERMEDIA links\n \n",

Among other payment method, the merchant suggests the use of a PISP service. As there is obviously a contract between the merchant and the PISP, there is no need of such a contract between the PSU and this PISP to initiate the process.  \nCase of the PSU that chooses to use the PISP service:  \n\n*   The merchant forwards the requested payment characteristics to the PISP and redirects the PSU to the PISP portal.\n*   The PISP requests from the PSU which ASPSP will be used.\n*   The PISP prepares the Payment Request and sends this request to the ASPSP.\n*   The Request can embed several payment instructions having different requested execution date.\n*   The beneficiary, as being the merchant, is set at the payment level.\n\n##### Transfer Request use case\n\nThe PISP forwards a transfer request on behalf of the owner of the account.\n\n*   The PSU provides the PISP with all information needed for the transfer.\n*   The PISP prepares the Transfer Request and sends this request to the relevant ASPSP that holds the debtor account.\n*   The Request can embed several payment instructions having different beneficiaries.\n*   The requested execution date, as being the same for all instructions, is set at the payment level.\n\n##### Standing Order Request use case\n\nThe PISP forwards a Standing Order request on behalf of the owner of the account.\n\n*   The PSU provides the PISP with all information needed for the Standing Order.\n*   The PISP prepares the Standing Order Request and sends this request to the relevant ASPSP that holds the debtor account.\n*   The Request embeds one single payment instruction with\n\n*   The requested execution date of the first occurrence\n*   The requested execution frequency of the payment in order to compute further execution dates\n*   An execution rule to handle cases when the computed execution dates cannot be processed (e.g. bank holydays)\n*   An optional end date for closing the standing Order\n\n#### Authentication flows for all use cases\n\nAs the request posted by the PISP to the ASPSP needs a PSU authentication before execution, this request will include:\n\n*   The specification of the authentication approaches that are supported by the PISP (any combination of \"REDIRECT\", \"EMBEDDED\" and \"DECOUPLED\" values).\n*   In case of possible REDIRECT or DECOUPLED authentication approach, one or two call-back URLs to be used by the ASPSP at the finalisation of the authentication and consent process :\n\n*   The first call-back URL will be called by the ASPSP if the Payment Request is processed without any error or rejection by the PSU\n*   The second call-back URL is to be used by the ASPSP in case of processing error or rejection by the PSU. Since this second URL is optional, the PISP might not provide it. In this case, the ASPSP will use the same URL for any processing result.\n*   Both call-back URLS must be used in a TLS-secured request.\n\n*   In case of possible \"EMBEDDED\" or \"DECOUPLED\" approaches, the PSU identifier that can be processed by the ASPSP for PSU recognition must have been set within the request body [debtor] structure.\n\nThe ASPSP saves the request and answers to the PISP. The answer embeds:\n\n*   A location link of the saved Request that will be further used to retrieve the Request and its status information.\n*   The specification of the chosen authentication approach taking into account both the PISP and the PSU capabilities.\n*   In case of chosen REDIRECT authentication approach, the URL to be used by the PISP for redirecting the PSU in order to perform a authentication.\n\nCase of the PSU neither gives nor denies his/her consent, the Request shall expire and is then rejected to the PISP. The expiration delay is specified by each ASPSP.  \n\n##### Redirect authentication approach\n\nWhen the chosen authentication approach within the ASPSP answers is set to \"REDIRECT\":  \n\n*   The PISP redirects the PSU to the ASPSP which authenticates the PSU\n*   The ASPSP asks the PSU to give (or deny) his/her consent to the Payment Request\n*   The PSU chooses or confirms which of his/her accounts shall be used by the ASPSP for the future Credit Transfer.\n*   The ASPSP is then able to initiate the subsequent Credit Transfer\n*   The ASPSP redirects the PSU to the PISP using one of the call-back URLs provided within the posted Payment Request\n\n![](https://www.stet.eu//assets/files/documents-api/pisp-redirect-authentication.png) ![](https://www.stet.eu//assets/files/documents-api/pisp-redirect-authentication2.png)\n\n##### Decoupled authentication approach\n\nWhen the chosen authentication approach is \"DECOUPLED\":  \n\n*   Based on the PSU identifier provided within the Payment Request by the PISP, the ASPSP gives the PSU with the Payment Request details and challenges the PSU for a Strong Customer Authentication on a decoupled device or application.\n*   The PSU chooses or confirms which of his/her accounts shall be used by the ASPSP for the future Credit Transfer.\n*   The ASPSP is then able to initiate the subsequent Credit Transfer\n*   The ASPSP notifies the PISP about the finalisation of the authentication and consent process by using one of the call-back URLs provided within the posted Payment Request\n\n![](https://www.stet.eu//assets/files/documents-api/pisp-decoupled-authentication.png) ![](https://www.stet.eu//assets/files/documents-api/pisp-decoupled-authentication2.png)\n\n##### Embedded authentication approach\n\nWhen the chosen authentication approach within the ASPSP answers is set to \"EMBEDDED\":  \n\n*   The TPP informs the PSU that a challenge is needed for completing the Payment Request processing. This challenge will be one of the following:\n\n*   A One-Time-Password sent by the ASPSP to the PSU on a separate device or application.\n*   A response computed by a specific device on base of a challenge sent by the ASPSP to the PSU on a separate device or application.\n\n*   The PSU unlock the device or application through a \"knowledge factor\" and/or an \"inherence factor\" (biometric), retrieves the Payment Request details and processes the data sent by the ASPSP;\n*   The PSU might choose or confirm which of his/her accounts shall be used by the ASPSP for the future Credit Transfer when the device or application allows it.\n*   When agreeing the Payment Request, the PSU enters the resulting authentication factor through the PISP interface which will forward it to the ASPSP through a confirmation request (cf. § 4.7)\n\n![](https://www.stet.eu//assets/files/documents-api/pisp-embedded-authentication.png) ![](https://www.stet.eu//assets/files/documents-api/pisp-embedded-authentication2.png)\n",

Thereafter, the AISP may ask for the first, next, previous or last page of results.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   The TPP has been registered by the Registration Authority for the AISP role\n*   The TPP and the PSU have a contract that has been enrolled by the ASPSP\n\n*   At this step, the ASPSP has delivered an OAUTH2 \"Authorization Code\" or \"Resource Owner Password\" access token to the TPP (cf. § 3.4.2).\n\n*   The TPP and the ASPSP have successfully processed a mutual check and authentication\n*   The TPP has presented its OAUTH2 \"Authorization Code\" or \"Resource Owner Password\" access token which allows the ASPSP to identify the relevant PSU and retrieve the linked PSU context (cf. § 3.4.2) is any.\n*   The ASPSP takes into account the access token that establishes the link between the PSU and the AISP.\n*   The TPP has previously retrieved the list of available accounts for the PSU\n\n### Business flow\n\nThe AISP requests the ASPSP on one of the PSU’s accounts. It may specify some selection criteria. The ASPSP answers by a set of transactions that matches the query. The result may be subject to pagination in order to avoid an excessive result set.\n",

Thereafter, the AISP may ask for the first, next, previous or last page of results.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   The TPP has been registered by the Registration Authority for the AISP role.\n*   The TPP and the PSU have a contract that has been enrolled by the ASPSP\n\n*   At this step, the ASPSP has delivered an OAUTH2 \"Authorization Code\" or \"Resource Owner Password\" access token to the TPP (cf. § 3.4.2).\n\n*   The TPP and the ASPSP have successfully processed a mutual check and authentication\n*   The TPP has presented its OAUTH2 \"Authorization Code\" or \"Resource Owner Password\" access token which allows the ASPSP to identify the relevant PSU and retrieve the linked PSU context (cf. § 3.4.2) if any.\n*   The ASPSP takes into account the access token that establishes the link between the PSU and the AISP.\n\n### Business Flow\n\nThe AISP asks for the trusted beneficiaries list. The ASPSP answers with a list of beneficiary details structure.\n",

Thanks to HYPERMEDIA, each account is returned with the links aiming to ease access to the relevant transactions and balances. The result may be subject to pagination (i.e. retrieving a partial result in case of having too many results) through a set of pages by the ASPSP. Thereafter, the AISP may ask for the first, next, previous or last page of results.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   The TPP has been registered by the Registration Authority for the AISP role.\n*   The TPP and the PSU have a contract that has been enrolled by the ASPSP\n\n*   At this step, the ASPSP has delivered an OAUTH2 \"Authorization Code\" or \"Resource Owner Password\" access token to the TPP (cf. § 3.4.2).\n\n*   The TPP and the ASPSP have successfully processed a mutual check and authentication\n*   The TPP has presented its OAUTH2 \"Authorization Code\" or \"Resource Owner Password\" access token which allows the ASPSP to identify the relevant PSU and retrieve the linked PSU context (cf. § 3.4.2) if any.\n*   The ASPSP takes into account the access token that establishes the link between the PSU and the AISP.\n\n### Business Flow\n\nThe TPP sends a request to the ASPSP for retrieving the list of the PSU payment accounts. The ASPSP computes the relevant PSU accounts and builds the answer as an accounts list. The result may be subject to pagination in order to avoid an excessive result set. Each payment account will be provided with its characteristics.\n",

The PISP uses the location link provided by the ASPSP in response of the posting of this request.  \nThe ASPSP returns the previously posted Payment/Transfer Request which is enriched with:  \n\n*   The resource identifiers given by the ASPSP\n*   The status information of the Payment Request and of the subsequent credit transfer\n\nThe status information must be available during at least 30 calendar days after the posting of the Payment Request. However, the ASPSP may increase this availability duration, based on its own rules.\n",

                    "notes": "### Description\n\nThe PISP sent a Payment/Transfer Request through a POST command.  \nThe ASPSP registered the Payment/Transfer Request, updated if necessary the relevant identifiers in order to avoid duplicates and returned the location of the updated Request.  \nThe PISP got the Payment/Transfer Request that has been updated with the resource identifiers, and eventually the status of the Payment/Transfer Request and the status of the subsequent credit transfer.  \nThe PISP request for the payment cancellation (global cancellation) or for some payment instructions cancellation (partial cancellation)\nNo other modification of the Payment/Transfer Request is allowed.  \n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   The TPP was registered by the Registration Authority for the PISP role\n*   The TPP was provided with an OAUTH2 \"Client Credential\" access token by the ASPSP (cf. § 3.4.3).\n*   The TPP previously posted a Payment/Transfer Request which was saved by the ASPSP (cf. § 4.5.3)\n\n*   The ASPSP answered with a location link to the saved Payment/Transfer Request (cf. § 4.5.4)\n*   The PISP retrieved the saved Payment/Transfer Request (cf. § 4.5.4)\n\n*   The TPP and the ASPSP successfully processed a mutual check and authentication\n*   The TPP presented its \"OAUTH2 Client Credential\" access token.\n*   The TPP presented the payment/transfer request.\n*   The PSU was successfully authenticated.\n\n### Business flow\n\nthe following cases can be applied:\n\n*   Case of a payment with multiple instructions or a standing order, the PISP asks to cancel the whole Payment/Transfer or Standing Order Request including all non-executed payment instructions by setting the [paymentInformationStatus] to \"RJCT\" and the relevant [statusReasonInformation] to \"DS02\" at payment level.\n*   Case of a payment with multiple instructions, the PISP asks to cancel one or several payment instructions by setting the [transactionStatus] to \"RJCT\" and the relevant [statusReasonInformation] to \"DS02\" at each relevant instruction level.\n\nSince the modification request needs a PSU authentication before committing, the modification request includes:\n\n*   The specification of the authentication approaches that are supported by the PISP (any combination of \"REDIRECT\", \"EMBEDDED\" and \"DECOUPLED\" values).\n*   In case of possible REDIRECT or DECOUPLED authentication approach, one or two call-back URLs to be used by the ASPSP at the finalisation of the authentication and consent process :\n\n*   The first call-back URL will be called by the ASPSP if the Transfer Request is processed without any error or rejection by the PSU\n*   The second call-back URL is to be used by the ASPSP in case of processing error or rejection by the PSU. Since this second URL is optional, the PISP might not provide it. In this case, the ASPSP will use the same URL for any processing result.\n*   Both call-back URLS must be used in a TLS-secured request.\n\n*   In case of possible \"EMBEDDED\" or \"DECOUPLED\" approaches, a PSU identifier that can be processed by the ASPSP for PSU recognition.\n\n*   The ASPSP saves the updated Payment/Transfer Request and answers to the PISP. The answer embeds\n\n*   The specification of the chosen authentication approach taking into account both the PISP and the PSU capabilities.\n*   In case of chosen REDIRECT authentication approach, the URL to be used by the PISP for redirecting the PSU in order to perform an authentication.\n\n### Authentication flows for both use cases\n\n#### Redirect authentication approach\n\nWhen the chosen authentication approach within the ASPSP answers is set to \"REDIRECT\":  \n\n*   The PISP redirects the PSU to the ASPSP which authenticates the PSU\n*   The ASPSP asks the PSU to give (or deny) his/her consent to the Payment Request global or partial Cancellation\n*   The ASPSP is then able to initiate the subsequent cancellation\n*   The ASPSP redirects the PSU to the PISP using one of the call-back URLs provided within the posted Payment Request cancellation\n\nIf the PSU neither gives nor denies his/her consent, the Cancellation Request shall expire and is then rejected to the PISP. The expiration delay is specified by each ASPSP.\n\n#### Decoupled authentication approach\n\nWhen the chosen authentication approach is \"DECOUPLED\":  \n\n*   Based on the PSU identifier provided within the Payment Request by the PISP, the ASPSP gives the PSU with the Payment Request details and challenges the PSU for a Strong Customer Authentication on a decoupled device or application.\n*   The PSU chooses or confirms which of his/her accounts shall be used by the ASPSP for the future Credit Transfer.\n*   The ASPSP is then able to initiate the subsequent Credit Transfer\n*   The ASPSP notifies the PISP about the finalisation of the authentication and consent process by using one of the call-back URLs provided within the posted Payment Request\n\nIf the PSU neither gives nor denies his/her consent, the Payment Request shall expire and is then rejected to the PISP. The expiration delay is specified by each ASPSP.  \n\n#### Embedded authentication approach\n\nWhen the chosen authentication approach within the ASPSP answers is set to \"EMBEDDED\":  \n\n*   The TPP informs the PSU that a challenge is needed for completing the Payment Request processing. This challenge will be one of the following:\n\n*   A One-Time-Password sent by the ASPSP to the PSU on a separate device or application.\n*   A response computed by a specific device on base of a challenge sent by the ASPSP to the PSU on a separate device or application.\n\n*   The PSU unlock the device or application through a \"knowledge factor\" and/or an \"inherence factor\" (biometric), retrieves the Payment Request details and processes the data sent by the ASPSP;\n*   The PSU might choose or confirm which of his/her accounts shall be used by the ASPSP for the future Credit Transfer when the device or application allows it.\n*   When agreeing the Payment Request, the PSU enters the resulting authentication factor through the PISP interface which will forward it to the ASPSP through a confirmation request (cf. § 4.7)\n\nCase of the PSU neither gives nor denies his/her consent, the Payment Request shall expire and is then rejected to the PISP. The expiration delay is specified by each ASPSP.\n",
